### What I learned

As my first React project, it was a great way to learn about the environment. How is everything connected, how to display elements. 

Undestanding functional components. 

Feeding a section of content and having prepared the layout for it, for example how the notes are created and displayed in a grid.  

How in the note component there's a reserved space for each element. 

The use of a [Modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal) package.
